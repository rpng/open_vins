# OpenVINS


Welcome to the OpenVINS project!
The OpenVINS project houses some core computer vision code along with a state-of-the art filter-based visual-inertial estimator.
The core filter is an [Extended Kalman filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Kalman_filter) which fuses inertial information with sparse visual feature tracks.
These visual feature tracks are fused leveraging the [Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4209642) sliding window formulation which allows for 3D features to update the state estimate without directly estimating the feature states in the filter.
Inspired by graph-based optimization systems, the included filter has modularity allowing for convenient covariance management with a proper type-based state system.
Please take a look at the feature list below for full details on what the system supports.

## News / Events

* **July 7, 2020** - Released zero velocity update for vehicle applications and direct initialization when standing still. See [PR#79](https://github.com/rpng/open_vins/pull/79) for details. 
* **May 18, 2020** - Released secondary pose graph example repository [ov_secondary](https://github.com/rpng/ov_secondary) based on [VINS-Fusion](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Fusion). OpenVINS now publishes marginalized feature track, feature 3d position, and first camera intrinsics and extrinsics. See [PR#66](https://github.com/rpng/open_vins/pull/66) for details and discussion.
* **April 3, 2020** - Released [v2.0](https://github.com/rpng/open_vins/releases/tag/v2.0) update to the codebase with some key refactoring, ros-free building, improved dataset support, and single inverse depth feature representation. Please check out the [release page](https://github.com/rpng/open_vins/releases/tag/v2.0) for details.
* **January 21, 2020** - Our paper has been accepted for presentation in [ICRA 2020](https://www.icra2020.org/). We look forward to seeing everybody there! We have also added links to a few videos of the system running on different datasets.

## Codebase Extensions

* **[ov_secondary](https://github.com/rpng/ov_secondary)** -
This is an example secondary thread which provides loop closure in a loosely coupled manner for [OpenVINS](https://github.com/rpng/open_vins).
This is a modification of the code originally developed by the HKUST aerial robotics group and can be found in their [VINS-Fusion](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Fusion) repository.
Here we stress that this is a loosely coupled method, thus no information is returned to the estimator to improve the underlying OpenVINS odometry.
This codebase has been modified in a few key areas including: exposing more loop closure parameters, subscribing to camera intrinsics, simplifying configuration such that only topics need to be supplied, and some tweaks to the loop closure detection to improve frequency.

* **[ov_maplab](https://github.com/rpng/ov_maplab)** -
This codebase contains the interface wrapper for exporting visual-inertial runs from [OpenVINS](https://github.com/rpng/open_vins) into the ViMap structure taken by [maplab](https://github.com/ethz-asl/maplab).
The state estimates and raw images are appended to the ViMap as OpenVINS runs through a dataset.
After completion of the dataset, features are re-extract and triangulate with maplab's feature system.
This can be used to merge multi-session maps, or to perform a batch optimization after first running the data through OpenVINS.
Some example have been provided along with a helper script to export trajectories into the standard groundtruth format.
