@section coding-style-overview Overview

Please note that if you have a good excuse to either break the rules or modify
them, feel free to do it (and update this guide accordingly, if appropriate).
Nothing is worse than rule that hurts productivity instead of improving it.
In general, the main aim of this style is:

- Vertical and horizontal compression, fitting more code on a screen while keeping the code readable.
- Do not need to enforce line wrapping if clarity is impacted (i.e. Jacobians)
- Consistent indentation and formatting rules to ensure readability (4 space tabbing)


The codebase is coded in [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) with accessor and getter function for most classes (there are a few exceptions).
We leverage the [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) documentation system with a post-processing script from [m.css](https://mcss.mosra.cz/documentation/doxygen/).
Please see @ref dev-docs for details on how our documentation is generated.
All functions should be commented both internally and externally with a focus on being as clear to a developer or user that is reading the code or documentation website.




@section coding-style-naming Naming Conventions

We have particular naming style for our orientations and positions that should be consistent throughout the project.
In general rotation matrices are the only exception of a variable that starts with a capital letter.
Both position and orientation variables should contain the frame of references.


@code{.cpp}
Eigen::Matrix<double,3,3> R_ItoC; //=> SO(3) rotation from IMU to camera frame
Eigen::Matrix<double,4,1> q_ItoC; //=> JPL quaternion rot from IMU to the camera
Eigen::Vector3d p_IinC; //=> 3d position of the IMU frame in the camera frame
Eigen::Vector3d p_FinG; //=> position of feature F in the global frame G
@endcode
