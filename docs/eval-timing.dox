@par Installation Warning
    If you plan to use the included plotting from the cpp code, you will need to make sure that you have matplotlib and python 2.7 installed. We use the to [matplotlib-cpp](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) to call this external library and generate the desired figures. Please see @ref gs-install-oveval for more details on the exact install.



@section eval-ov-timing-collection Collection

To profile the different parts of the system we record the timing information from directly inside the  @ref ov_msckf::VioManager.
The file should be comma separated format, with the first column being the timing, and the last column being the total time (units are all in seconds).
The middle columns should describe how much each component takes (whose names are extracted from the header of the csv file).
You can use the bellow tools as long as you follow this format, and add or remove components as you see fit to the middle columns.

To evaluate the computational load (*not computation time*), we have a python script that leverages the [psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) python package to record percent CPU and memory consumption.
This can be included as an additional node in the launch file which only needs the node which you want the reported information of.
This will poll the node for its percent memory, percent cpu, and total number of threads that it uses.
This can be useful if you wish to compare different methods on the same platform, but doesn't make sense to use this to compare the running of the same algorithm or different algorithms *across* different hardware devices.

@code{.xml}
<node name="recorder_timing" pkg="ov_eval" type="pid_ros.py" output="screen">
    <param name="nodes"   type="str" value="/run_subscribe_msckf" />
    <param name="output"  type="str" value="/tmp/psutil_log.txt" />
</node>
@endcode

It is also important to note that if the estimator has multiple nodes, you can subscribe to them all by specifying their names as a comma separated string.
For example to evaluate the computation needed for [VINS-Mono](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono/blob/master/vins_estimator/launch/euroc.launch) multi-node system we can do:

@code{.xml}
<node name="recorder_timing" pkg="ov_eval" type="pid_ros.py" output="screen">
    <param name="nodes"   type="str" value="/feature_tracker,/vins_estimator,/pose_graph" />
    <param name="output"  type="str" value="/tmp/psutil_log.txt" />
</node>
@endcode

@subsection eval-ov-timing-flame Script "timing_flamegraph"
The flame graph script looks to recreate a [FlameGraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph) of the key components of the system.
While we do not trace all functions, the key "top level" function times are recorded to file to allow for insight into what is taking the majority of the computation.
The file should be comma separated format, with the first column being the timing, and the last column being the total time.
The middle columns should describe how much each component takes (whose names are extracted from the header of the csv file).

@code{.shell-session}
rosrun ov_eval timing_flamegraph <file_times.txt>
rosrun ov_eval timing_flamegraph timing_mono_ethV101.txt

@subsection eval-ov-timing-compare Script "timing_comparison"
This script is use to compare the run-time of different runs of the algorithm.
This take in the same file as the flame graph and is recorded in the @ref ov_msckf::VioManager.
The file should be comma separated format, with the first column being the timing, and the last column being the total time.
The middle columns should describe how much each component takes (whose names are extracted from the header of the csv file).

@subsection eval-ov-timing-percentages Script "timing_percentages"
This utility allows for comparing the resources used by the algorithm on a specific platform.
An example usage would be how the memory and cpu requirements increase as the state size grows or as more cameras are added.
You will need to record the format using the `pid_ros.py` node (see @ref eval-ov-timing-collection for details on how to use it).
Remember that 100\% cpu usage means that it takes one cpu thread to support the system, while 200\% means it takes two cpu threads to support the system (see [this link](https://superuser.com/a/457634/707974) for an explanation).
The folder structure needed is as follows:

@code{.txt}
psutil_logs/
    ov_mono/
        run1.txt
        run2.txt
        run3.txt
    ov_stereo/
        run1.txt
        run2.txt
        run3.txt
@endcode


@code{.shell-session}
rosrun ov_eval timing_percentages <timings_folder>
rosrun ov_eval timing_percentages psutil_logs/

Example output:
