@section gs-install-ros ROS Dependency

Our codebase is built on top of the [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/) and has been tested building on Ubuntu 16.04 systems with ROS Kinetic Kame.
We also recommend installing the [catkin_tools](https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools) build for easy ROS building.
Please see the official instructions [here](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu), which have also been copied below.

@code{.shell-session}
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver 'hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full
sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools
echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
@endcode



@section gs-install-opencv OpenCV Dependency

We leverage [OpenCV 3.4.6](https://opencv.org/) for this project and recommend you compile it from source.
You can try linking to the one included with ROS but we have always had success with building from source to ensure we have all contributed OpenCV libraries.
One should make sure you can see some of the "contrib" (e.g. xfeature2d) to ensure you have linked to the contrib modules.

@code{.shell-session}
git clone --branch 3.4.6 https://github.com/opencv/opencv/
git clone --branch 3.4.6 https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/
mkdir opencv/build/
cd opencv/build/
cmake -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=../../opencv_contrib/modules ..
make -j8
sudo make install
@endcode




@section gs-install-openvins Cloning Open VINS


Now that we have ROS and OpenCV install we can setup a catkin workspace and build the project!
If you did not install the catkin_tools build system, you should be able to build using the standard `catkin_make` command that is included with ROS.
If you run into any problems please google search the issue first and if you are unable to find a solution please open an issue on our github page.
After the build is successful please following the @ref gs-tutorial guide on getting a dataset and running the system.

@code{.shell-session}
mkdir -p ~/workspace/catkin_ws_ov/src/
cd ~/workspace/catkin_ws_ov/src/
git clone https://github.com/rpng/open_vins/
cd ..
catkin build
@endcode
