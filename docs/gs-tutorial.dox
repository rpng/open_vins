@page gs-tutorial Simple Tutorial

This guide assumes that you have already built the project successfully and are now ready to run the program on some datasets.
If you have not compiled the program yet please follow the @ref gs-installing guide.
The first that we will download is a dataset to run the program on.
In this tutorial we will run on the [EuRoC MAV Dataset](https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) which provides monochrome stereo images at 20Hz with a MEMS ADIS16448 IMU at 200Hz.

All configuration information for the system is exposed to the user in the launch file.
We will create a launch file that will launch our MSCKF estimation node and feed the ROS bag into the system in serial.
One can take a look in the [launch](https://github.com/rpng/open_vins/tree/master/ov_msckf/launch) folder for more examples.

One will need to edit the path to the ROS bag that was downloaded from the [EuRoC MAV Dataset](https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) website.
Lets now look at the different sections in this launch file in more detail.
A lot of the parameters that are exposed have not been included in the above file and will instead be set to their default values.
Please take a look at the other launch files or the ov_msckf::VioManager constructor for more details on what parameters are exposed.



| Group | Description |
|---|---|
| bag topics | ROS topics that we will parse the IMU and camera data from. If we are only using one camera, i.e. monocular, then only the first camera topic is used. |
| bag params. | Location of the bag we will read along with the start time, in seconds, and duration we want to run on. |
| world/filter params. | This has most of the core parameters that can be tuned to improve filter performance including the sliding window size, representation, gravity, and number of environmental SLAM features. One can also change the number of cameras from 1 to 2 to do stereo matching and update. |
| tracker/extractor params. | For our visual front-end tracker we have a few key parameters that we can tune, most importantly is the number of features extracted. |
| sensor noise values | Since our feature measurement function is on the raw pixels (see @ref update-feat), the pixel noise should be 1 pixel if we have good calibration. We additionally have the *continuous time* white noise and random walk values for our IMU. |
| camera intrinsics | Camera intrinsic values from the EurocMav dataset. |
| camera extrinsics | Camera extrinsics values from the EurocMav dataset. Note that they have the rotation from camera to imu and position of the imu in the camera in the imu frame. |



If we create a launch file `tutorial.launch` in our `/ov_msckf/launch/` folder with the above contents and have replaced the bag path to the downloaded bag location, we can do the following.


@code{.shell-session}
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch ov_msckf tutorial.launch
@endcode
