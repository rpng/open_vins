     * @brief Initializer for visual-inertial system.
     *
     * This class has a series of functions that can be used to initialize your system.
     * Right now we have our implementation that assumes that the imu starts from standing still.
     * In the future we plan to add support for structure-from-motion dynamic initialization.
     *
     * To initialize from standstill:
     * 1. Collect all inertial measurements
     * 2. See if within the last window there was a jump in acceleration
     * 3. If the jump is past our threshold we should init (i.e. we have started moving)
     * 4. Use the *previous* window, which should have been stationary to initialize orientation
     * 5. Return a roll and pitch aligned with gravity and biases.
