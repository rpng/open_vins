         *
         * After propagation, normally we augment the state with an new clone that is at the new update timestep.
         * This augmentation clones the IMU pose and adds it to our state's clone map.
         * If we are doing time offset calibration we also make our cloning a function of the time offset.
         * Time offset logic is based on Mingyang Li and Anastasios I. Mourikis paper: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0278364913515286
         * We can write the current clone at the true imu base clock time as the follow:
         * \f{align*}{
         * {}^{I_{t+t_d}}_G\bar{q} &= \begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{2} {}^{I_{t+\hat{t}_d}}\boldsymbol\omega \tilde{t}_d \\ 1\end{bmatrix}\otimes{}^{I_{t+\hat{t}_d}}_G\bar{q} \\

         * \f${}^{I_{t+\hat{t}_d}}\boldsymbol\omega\f$ is the angular velocity at the end of propagation with biases removed.
         * This is off by some smaller error, so to get to the true imaging time in the imu base clock, we can append some small timeoffset error.
         * Thus the Jacobian in respect to our time offset during our cloning procedure is the following:
         * \f{align*}{
         * \frac{\partial {}^{I_{t+t_d}}_G\tilde{\boldsymbol\theta}}{\partial \tilde{t}_d} &= {}^{I_{t+\hat{t}_d}}\boldsymbol\omega \\
